                <div class="md:flex-grow">
                  <p class="leading-relaxed">Cats, known scientifically as Felis catus, are small carnivorous mammals renowned for their agility, grace, and independent nature. With a history dating back thousands of years, cats were first domesticated in ancient Egypt, where they were revered as symbols of protection, fertility, and guardianship. Over time, cats spread across the globe, becoming valued companions and skilled hunters, adept at controlling rodent populations. Today, cats continue to hold a special place in human society, providing companionship, comfort, and joy to millions of people worldwide. Their roles as beloved pets, skilled hunters, and cherished members of the family highlight the enduring bond between humans and cats throughout history.</p>

                <div class="md:flex-grow">
                  <p class="leading-relaxed">Cats exhibit a diverse range of physical traits, including body sizes, coat colors, patterns, ear shapes, and eye colors, contributing to their unique appearance and individuality. Alongside their physical attributes, cats rely on their acute senses—such as sharp hearing, keen eyesight, strong sense of smell, and sensitive touch—to navigate their environment, communicate with other cats, and thrive as both hunters and companions.</p>

                  <p class="leading-relaxed">Cats display a range of typical behaviors, including hunting, grooming, and distinct communication methods like vocalizations, body language, and scent marking. Their sleeping patterns can vary from short naps to long stretches of rest. In multi-cat households, territorial behavior and social dynamics play important roles, shaping their interactions and relationships with other felines. Understanding these behaviors is key to providing a fulfilling environment for our feline companions.</p>

                    <p class="leading-relaxed">Cats have varying lifespans, typically ranging from 12 to 15 years, though factors like genetics, diet, environment, and healthcare can influence longevity. Understanding the different life stages of cats—from playful kittens to wise seniors—is crucial for providing appropriate care at each stage. As kittens grow into adults and eventually seniors, their needs evolve, requiring adjustments in nutrition, exercise, and veterinary care to ensure they lead happy and healthy lives.</p>
